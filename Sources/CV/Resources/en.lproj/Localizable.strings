ABOUT_ME="About me";
ABOUT="At the age of 12 I discovered an app called Codea, at that time I didn't really know what it was but apparently it allowed you to make games from an iPad. I started experimenting with the included demo projects. What's this number doing? What happens if I change this letter? Why the words 'function' and 'end' are repeated so much?

By trial and error I discovered the fundamentals about programming.

Eventually I found out about a kind of \"manual\" about Lua (the programming language used by Codea) that mentioned really strange but interesting concepts. Late on I would discover the importance of reading the documentation.

On February 2013 I was part of the first group of the initiative Apps.co, a program prompted by the ICT Ministry of Colombia, where I learned HTML5 and CSS3.

Later that year, in May, I took a course about iOS app development by KeepCoding (at that time it was called AGBO Training).

I continued exploring the world of mobile development and, by means of my father's company, Bakura, I was able to work on many projects which I mention a few below.";
